# PGA-Tour-Analysis

This is an analysis of PGA Tour players. The goal of this project is to look at data from the past Professional Golfers Association's (PGA) history to see if a higher fairway hit percentage relates to the amount of money made on the PGA tour. I also look at different things like driving accuracy, greens hit in regulation, and number of top 10s in a season.
